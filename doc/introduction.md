# summary

When rain falls from the atmosphere and onto the land surface, the water begins to flow, and move in a direction that is related to the sloping land surface. 
Over the length scale of a few meters, the water flows in the direction of "steepest descent", that is, the steepest nearby direction. 
When this process is integrated over the entire surface area of the rainfall, flows will end up intersecting and joining up, becoming larger and stronger flows.
This causes erosion, 
<!-- 
The model uses a D8 routing scheme to route rainfall over the surface of a DEM.
All flow is assumed to be surface runoff.
The hydrograph is scaled to the maximum baseflow equilibrium condition. 
These watersheds drain directly into the Columbia River in Washington state, (Lat 47°10'03.8"N, Lon 120°07'31.9"W).
